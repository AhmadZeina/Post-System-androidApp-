**Application Idea:**

The application is based on providing a system that allows for adding, editing, and deleting posts, which are text-based.

With the ability to display all the posts that the user has added, and provide the appropriate functions to edit any text that has been added and saved, and finally the ability to delete any text post.

This is done through a simple interface that combines the proposed tasks with a suitable design to maintain the application's work while ensuring the efficiency and logic of the functions.

In addition to a notification system that informs the user of the success of the operation, whether it is saving, editing, or deleting, and also a notification asking to select a specific text post when requesting deletion or editing.

**Application Interface:**

**Documenting Application Functionality:**

**1. MainActivity Class:**

**Define Variables:**

* `editTextPost`: This is a TextView that represents the text input field for the post.
* `saveButton`: This is a Button that represents the "Save" button.
* `editButton`: This is a Button that represents the "Edit" button.
* `deleteButton`: This is a Button that represents the "Delete" button.
* `listViewPosts`: This is a ListView that will display the list of created posts.
* `posts`: This is a String array that will store the text of the posts.
* `postAdapter`: This is an Adapter that will link the post data to the ListView.
* `currentPosition`: This is an Integer variable that represents the index of the currently selected post (-1 indicates no post selected).

**Define OnCreate Function:**

This function is called when the Activity is first created and assigns the contents of the class to the activity_main.xml layout file.

**Bind Elements:**

Initialize the interface elements and bind them using their IDs.

**Define Button Action Functions:**

Assign OnClickListeners to the buttons, so that when a specific button is clicked, the savePost(), editPost(), or deletePost() functions will be called, each corresponding to the button.

**savePost() Function:**

* This function is called when the "Save" button is clicked.
* It takes the text from the EditText and removes any leading or trailing spaces.
* If the post text is not empty, the function adds the post to the ArrayList of posts.
* Then it clears the text written in the input field.
* Finally, it displays a "Post saved" notification.
* If the post text is empty, it displays a "Please enter a post" notification.

**editPost() Function:**

* This function is called when the "Edit" button is clicked.
* It takes the text from the EditText and removes any leading or trailing spaces.
* If the selected text is not empty and the current post position is not -1, the new text is assigned to the current post.
* Finally, it displays a "Post edited" notification.
* If the selected text is empty or the user has not selected the text, a "Please select a post to edit" notification will appear.

**deletePost() Function:**

* This function is called when the "Delete" button is clicked.
* If a post is currently selected (currentPosition != -1), it is removed from the post display array.
* It notifies the Adapter that the dataset has changed and clears the EditText.
* Resets the current position to -1 and displays a "Post deleted" notification.
* If no post is selected, a "Please select a post to delete" notification will be displayed.

**Application Usage:**

1. Enter the post text in the provided field.
2. Clicking the "Save" button will save the post to the display interface and display a "Saved" notification.
3. Clicking the "Edit" button will display a notification to select a specific post to edit.
4. Clicking the "Delete" button will display a notification to confirm the deletion of the selected post.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided code is a simplified example and may require additional implementation for a complete application.
* Error handling and validation should be implemented to ensure the application's robustness.
* User interface design and layout should be refined for a better user experience.
